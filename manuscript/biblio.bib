 abstract = {Implicit-explicit (IMEX) linear multistep methods are popular techniques for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with terms of different types. While fixed timestep versions of such schemes have been developed and studied, implicit-explicit schemes also naturally arise in general situations where the temporal smoothness of the solution changes. In this paper we consider easily implementable variable step-size implicit-explicit (VSIMEX) linear multistep methods for time-dependent PDEs. Families of order-p, p step VSIMEX schemes are constructed and analyzed, where p ranges from 1 to 4. The corresponding schemes are simple to implement and have the property that they reduce to the classical IMEX schemes whenever constant time step-sizes are imposed. The methods are validated on the Burgers' equation. These results demonstrate that by varying the time step-size, VSIMEX methods can outperform their fixed time step counterparts while still maintaining good numerical behavior.},

    ABSTRACT = {A simple model of nonlinear salt-ﬁnger convection in two dimensions is derived and studied. The model is valid in the limit of a small solute to heat diffusivity ratio and a large density ratio, which is relevant to both oceanographic and astrophysical applications. Two limits distinguished by the magnitude of the Schmidt number are found. For order one Schmidt numbers, appropriate for astrophysical applications, a modiﬁed Rayleigh–Bénard system with large-scale damping due to a stabilizing temperature is obtained. For large Schmidt numbers, appropriate for the oceanic setting, the model combines a prognostic equation for the solute ﬁeld and a diagnostic equation for inertia-free momentum dynamics. Two distinct saturation regimes are identiﬁed for the second model: the weakly driven regime is characterized by a large-scale ﬂow associated with a balance between advection and linear instability, while the strongly-driven regime produces multiscale structures, resulting in a balance between energy input through linear instability and energy transfer between scales. For both regimes, we analytically predict and numerically conﬁrm the dependence of the kinetic energy and salinity ﬂuxes on the ratio between solutal and thermal Rayleigh numbers. The spectra and probability density functions are also computed.},

A review of the results of our own research and published data of domestic and foreign authors for the 117-year period (from 1900 to 2018) is presented. Information from regional archival documents and materials of researchers that are not accessible to the general public is presented. It is shown that the moose has a number of positive qualities favoring its introduction to livestock. Due to the domestication of moose, man is given the opportunity to use moose resources more efficiently than by hunting, to obtain additional types of products and to conduct research and educational activities.},
